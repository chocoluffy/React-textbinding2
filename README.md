### Main improvement from last version ###

1. Added sensitive text info filter
when enter something like "yushunzhe" inside the input field, it will gives out a alarm notice implemented in Bootstrap.

2. Added a cool heartbeat effect
using CSS3, we can simulate the cool effect of haertbeat. Key idea here: use :before and :after with some animation functions.
